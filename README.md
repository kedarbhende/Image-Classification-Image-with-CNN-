# Image-Classification-Image-with-CNN-
Built and trained a custom 6-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset across 10 object categories (airplanes, cars, animals, etc.). The model achieved 85%+ test accuracy, demonstrating strong feature-learning capability on low-resolution RGB images.
